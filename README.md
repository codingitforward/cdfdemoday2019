### Introduction
The Civic Digital Fellowship is the first of its kind data science and technology internship program for innovative students to solve pressing problems in federal agencies. It is the product of a collaboration between [Coding it Forward](https://www.codingitforward.com), and six federal agencies: the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov), [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov) (HHS), [General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov) (GSA), [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov), [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov) (NIH), and [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services](https://www.uscis.gov/). The Civic Digital Fellowship also wouldn't be possible without support from our generous supporters: Schmidt Futures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and Knight Foundation.

Meet the third cohort of Civic Digital Fellows: [Introducing the 2019 Civic Digital Fellows](https://blog.codingitforward.com/introducing-the-2019-civic-digital-fellows-41469f28561d).
